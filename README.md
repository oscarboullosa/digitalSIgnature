<!-- Blockchain Security with Python -->

<h1>Welcome to Blockchain Security</h1>
<p>Explore the repository where cryptography and security dance in harmony! This Python script, powered by the <code>cryptography</code> library, delves into the world of blockchain, digital signatures, and cybersecurity.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Key Generation:</strong> Automatically generates a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private) using the robust RSA algorithm.</li>
  <li><strong>Message Signing:</strong> Employs the private key to sign messages, creating unique digital fingerprints that validate the sender's authenticity.</li>
  <li><strong>Signature Verification:</strong> Utilizes the public key to verify the authenticity of signed messages, ensuring data integrity and origin validation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Clone this repository to your local machine:</li>
  <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-security.git</code>
  <li>Ensure you have Python 3 installed.</li>
  <li>Install the required dependencies:</li>
  <code>pip install cryptography</code>
  <li>Run the example script:</li>
  <code>python blockchain_security.py</code>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Explore the provided script to understand the orchestration of cryptographic keys, message signing, and signature verification. Feel free to integrate this functionality into your projects or adapt it to suit your cybersecurity needs.</p>

<h2>Example Output</h2>
